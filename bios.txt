 Nicolas Christin Carnegie Mellon University Associate Professor, SCS / ISR and EPP Program Director, Societal Computing Ph.D. program Affiliate faculty appointments in CyLab , ECE and INI Bio sketch I am an Associate Professor (with tenure ) at Carnegie Mellon University , jointly appointed in the School of Computer Science ( Institute for Software Research ) and in the department of Engineering and Public Policy . I am the director of the Societal Computing Ph.D. program . I am also a core faculty member of CyLab , our university-wide security institute, and have courtesy appointments in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, and in the Information Networking Institute . I am a 2017 CSIS fellow , and a 2019 Carnegie Institute of Technology Dean Early Career fellow . I received a Diplme dIngnieur (1999) from cole Centrale de Lille , a Masters (2000) and a Ph.D. (2003) in Computer Science from the University of Virginia . In the final year (2002-2003) of my Ph.D., I was working at Nortel Networks . I then spent two wonderful years (2003-2005) as a postdoctoral fellow in the School of Information at UC Berkeley , before joining Carnegie Mellon in July 2005. I was a faculty-in-residence for three years (2005-2008) CyLab Japan , the research and education center CMU used to have in Kbe, which remains one of my favorite cities. After coming back to the US, I served as Associate Director of the Information Networking Institute from 2008 through 2013, as a research faculty in ECE from 2013 through 2016, and as a research faculty in my current departments from 2016 through 2019. I am on Twitter as @nc2y . Research overview My research interest is in computer and information systems security. Most of my work is at the boundary of systems, networking and policy research. While a good portion of my research activities could be qualified as applied research, I try as much as possible to rely on strong theoretical foundations in my work. In addition, most of my recent work is informed by empirical data measurements (of users, networks, economic transactions, ), so that the term "security analytics" is an appropriate short qualifier. More specifically, the different inter-related research threads in which I am currently involved are: [in brackets, some of the venues where we published on the subject] Online crime modeling : Current security attacks are more often than not financially motivated. We postulate that, by getting a more precise picture of the economic interactions between the different actors involved, we can better understand how to disrupt or thwart these attacks. This line of work is very applied, and combines economic modeling, network measurements, and public policy research. [KDD'19, USENIX Sec'18, PETS'18, IMC'17, USENIX Sec'15, CCS'14, ESORICS'14, EC'13, WWW'13, CCS'11, USENIX Sec'11, CCS'10, ] Predictive security analytics : Wouldnt it be nice if we could foresee security issues before they actually harm users or infrastructure operators? We have shown this might be possible. We have developed systems to proactively detect exposure to attacks, both at the server and at the user levels. This work combines large-scale measurements with machine learning, and is closely related to our work on online crime modeling. [CCS'18, USENIX Sec'14] Continuous worldwide monitoring of online censorship : This line of work aims to continuously understand how governments attempt to control the information their users see, either by blocking access or by injecting specific content to affect public discourse. In particular, on the blocking side, we are very interested in examples of covert censorship, in which the censor silently terminates user connections, as opposed to overt censorship, where the censor explicitly tells users they are attempting to access restricted contents when blocking them. (The latter might be justifiable; the former usually is not, and gives interesting clues on some of the geopolitical dynamics at play.) Measuring interference at scale is incredibly challenging: country policies vary widely, censored pages change all the time, discriminating between random errors and actual malice is hard, and attempting to minimize human involvement to limit actual risk to people is tricky. We partner with ICLab at the University of Massachusetts and the Open Technology Fund in this multi-disciplinary endeavor, that spans computer networking and security, language processing, and even geopolitics. [Oakland'20, IMC'18, PETS'17] Usability and security : Making systems more secure has generally been at odds with what humans are good at; for instance, longer passwords are near-impossible to memorize, complex security policies are ignored and therefore useless, and so forth. This has resulted in large security meltdowns. Rather than treating human factors as a constraint in secure system design, we try to exploit what people are skilled at to make systems more secure. For instance, humans can very quickly recognize patterns, make inferences from incomplete information, and respond positively to proper messaging. Our work in that space finds applications in authentication applications, smart password meters, mobile payment systems, automated teller machines, to name a few. Software highlights include our open-source Carnegie Mellon password meter , and our neural network-based password cracker . For this work, we won the 2020 Allen Newell Award. [CCS'20, CHI'19, CHI'18, CHI'17, USENIX Sec'16, CHI'16, USENIX Sec'15, PETS'15, CHI'15, CHI'14, CCS'13, USENIX Sec'12, SOUPS'12, Oakland'12, CHI'11, FC'11, SOUPS'08, CHI'08, ] Security economics : We keep hearing about security attacks and breaches, despite the fact that most security problems have relatively low-cost solutions (e.g., patching, stronger access control, audits). I am interested in 1) understanding why, from an economic standpoint, people and corporations are seemingly either not investing enough in security, or investing in the wrong things, and 2) finding out if there are economic remedies or incentive compatible algorithms, that we, as a society, can use to improve this sad state of affairs. Behavioral economics, game theory as well as system design play a significant role in this cross-disciplinary work. [AAAI'15, IJCAI'13, CSF'11, ESORICS'10, FC'10, EC'08, WWW'08, ] The College of Engineering and the School of Computer Science have both produced slick videos ( Engineering , Computer Science ) in which I give high-level overviews of what my group is working on. Cross-cutting several of these projects, I am one of the co-PIs of the Security Behavior Observatory , a longitudinal, in situ user behavior measurement panel. Last but not least, our lab is a contributor to the DHS IMPACT Cybersecurity data portal .

This research was also featured on Marketplace (August 28, 2012) (radio), on NTN24 (August 14, 2012) (television), and extensively discussed in a Surprisingly Free (August 28, 2012) podcast. This piece of research has continued attracting a bit of attention whenever articles appear about the "deep web." For instance, it was quoted in this long article in Frances Le Nouvel Observateur (July 4, 2013) . After the trial of the Silk Road founder concluded, CNBC (June 1, 2015) rediscovered it. Our follow-up work on the anonymous marketplace ecosystem was extensively covered in Wired (August 12, 2015) , Motherboard (August 12, 2015) , the Washington Post (August 12, 2015) , the Daily Beast (August 20, 2015) , in French in Le Monde (August 13, 2015) , and in German in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (August 14, 2015) . It is also cited in CoinDesk (August 16, 2015) , and the New Zealand Herald (August 14, 2015) . Our loosely related work on Bitcoin exchanges was discussed in Wired UK (April 26, 2013). Our 2011 Financial Cryptography paper on figuring out how much it would take to incentivize people to adopt horrible security practices did not garner a lot of attention when it was originally published, but received extensive coverage after I presented the results at the 2014 Security and Human Behavior workshop: on Engadget (June 15, 2014), Business Insider (June 17, 2014), the Register (June 18, 2014), Slashdot (June 19, 2014), and Bruce Schneiers blog (June 19, 2014), among many others. Our USENIX Security 2014 paper on predicting impending web server compromises was covered in the Daily Dot (August 21, 2014) and The Register (August 22, 2014). Earlier in my career, our work on illicit online pharmacies got a bit of coverage: CMU front page (August 11, 2011) , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , Pittsburgh Tribune , National Public Radio (August 12, 2011) . Even earlier, our Undercover project was featured on the CMU front page (January 14, 2008) , in The Tartan (January 21, 2008) , [Dark Reading (February 5, 2008)]( http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=145104&amp;WT.svl=news1 _2), Network World (February 8, 2008) , PC World (February 10, 2008) , and was "slashdotted" (February 8, 2008) . Our research on passwords was the object of a feature article in Forbes (April 21, 2015), and in the Washington Post (September 8, 2017). Along with our work on online crime, it was also prominently featured in a Nature article (May 12, 2016). The Register (June 22, 2015) wrote on the problems we identified with nation-scale brokered identification schemes ; Computing (June 23, 2015) discussed the GDS response .

Public service Since September 2017, I have been serving on the Research subcommittee of the Financial Research Advisory Committee , U.S. Department of Treasury Office of Financial Research . On March 15, 2018, I testified before the Subcommittee on Terrorism & Illicit Finance, Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, 115th Congress, in a hearing entitled After the Breach: The Monetization and Illicit Use of Stolen Data . My written testimony is here , and the video of the entire hearing is here . My oral testimony starts at 35'55 . Miscellanea The Silk Road paper eventually indirectly led to my silver screen debut: I got a few seconds of screen time in the Deep Web documentary movie by Alex Winter . So, I technically have a Bacon number of 3 or less (me, Keanu Reeves, Miriam Margolyes, Kevin Bacon) to go along my Erds number of 3 or less (me, Ariel Procaccia, Noga Alon, Paul Erds) . I am writing "technically," because there is controversy about whether documentaries should count. But still, it is fun to have a plausible claim to being one of the people to have a finite Erds-Bacon number . (I am actually reasonably likely to have a finite Erds-Bacon-Sabbath number , but thats a story for another day, which involves harkening back to my misspent youth.) A more fun/random fact is that Tim Vidas and I are one of the very rare advisor-advisee pairs to both have (independently computable) finite Erds-Bacon numbers, since Tim appeared in the DEFCON documentary . My own post-doctoral advisor, John Chuang , also has a finite Erds-Bacon number, through different chains. So, that is (arguably) three academic generations of Erds-Bacon number holders in a row! A long, long time ago, I was responsible for getting the ns-2 / nam network simulator to compile and work natively under MS Windows/Cygwin. I have, however, transferred maintenance to the ns-2 development team more than fifteen years ago, so I am really not the right person to ask anymore, especially given that most of this has been made obsolete by ns-3 .
